    <p class="selected">This article is focused on English - language literature rather than the literature of England, so that it includes
      writers from Scotland, Wales, the Crown dependencies , and the whole of Ireland, as well as literature in English from countries of the former
      British Empire, including the United States. However , until the early 19th century, it only deals with the literature of the United Kingdom,
      the Crown dependencies and Ireland. It does not include literature written in the other languages of Britain .
      The English language has developed over the course of more than 1,400 years. The earliest forms of English , a set of Anglo-Frisian dialects
      brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the fifth century, are called Old English . Beowulf is the most famous work in Old English ,
      and has achieved national epic status in England, despite being set in Scandinavia. However, following the Norman conquest of England in 1066,
      the written form of the Anglo-Saxon language became less common. Under the influence of the new aristocracy, French became the standard language
      of courts, parliament, and polite society. The English spoken after the Normans came is known as Middle English . This form of English lasted
      until the 1470s, when the Chancery Standard ( late Middle English ), a London-based form of English , became widespread. Geoffrey Chaucer (1343-1400),
      author of The Canterbury Tale , was a significant figure in the development of the legitimacy of vernacular Middle English at a time when the dominant
      literary languages in England were still French and Latin . The invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg in 1439 also helped to standardise
      the language, as did the King James Bible (1611), and the Great Vowel Shift.</p>
